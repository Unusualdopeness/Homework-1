# Homework-1 Code Refractor
My assignment for this project was to refactor the code, to improve the accesibility of the site, and improving the code without changing what it's supposed to look like and show. 

# What was changed?
As far as the code goes, I cleaned up the css, as there were multiple tags with identical atrributes. By condensing grouping them together based on their attributes, the css code is much easier to naviagte. I also changed muliple div tags in the html to differnt names to avoid any confusion as to what was what when it came to the code. I also added alt tags to the images to improve acccessibility. Overall i also spaced out the code to make it easier to read.
